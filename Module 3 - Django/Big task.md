# Big task - end of course

## Design and implement a Django web application by choice

Here are some suggestions:

* Calendar application - store meetings with other people, places and dates
* TODOs application - keep track of your current tasks. TODOs usually have title, could have additional description, priorities, deadlines, types etc.
* Social network with users, roles, friend lists etc. You can even try to mimic an existing one.
* Expenses tracking app - the users should be able to track the amount of money the spend for different things with labels and date. Having a few predefined categories with the option to add more would be nice. Some kind of statistics is required - last week, last month, last year etc.

### General requirements

* Create at least two different models with appropriate relation.
* Use the template system.
* Adding your models to the admin panel is required.

### Optional requirements

* Create base templates and extend them
* Use static files
* Extend the admin panel so your models are visualized better.

### Non-required work

* Completely finished and working application
